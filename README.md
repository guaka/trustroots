## Volunteering

[developers.trustroots.org](http://developers.trustroots.org/)

You don't have to be a programmer to participate. Check [volunteers page](https://www.trustroots.org/volunteering) for more info.

## Development

Trustroots has a [developer portal](http://developers.trustroots.org/) with
information about the API and other methods of interacting with the project.

To work on Trustroots itself, read on! We have two main ways of running the
software for development:

### Running locally

Install the stack on your localhost and run NodeJS. This approach takes a little more time to setup, and bit more manual configuration, but is super fast, and can be easier to work with. See [INSTALL.md](https://github.com/Trustroots/trustroots/blob/master/INSTALL.md) for details.

### Running with Docker

If you are familiar with Docker, this is the easiest and quickest way to get started. See [INSTALL-DOCKER.md](https://github.com/Trustroots/trustroots/blob/master/INSTALL-DOCKER.md) for further details. Running through Docker can be a little bit slower.

## GitHub

We use GitHub for code management and issue tracking. Feel free to [create an issue](https://github.com/Trustroots/trustroots/issues/new) there if you run into an issue setting up the system.

The `master` branch is bleeding edge development. `production` is what's running on our servers.

## Developer communication

We are using Slack for communications, contact [Kasper](https://www.trustroots.org/profile/guaka) (kasper at trustroots dot org) or [Mikael](https://www.trustroots.org/profile/mikael) if you want an account. You can also contact us for an invite without queuing.

If Slack is too proprietary for you, note that we are considering setting up a Discourse forum. For now you can also use the GitHub issues for communication purposes.

It's also great if you join the [hacker tribe](https://www.trustroots.org/tribes).

Idea: find Trustroots developers in your area, meet up and hack on stuff together.

## MEAN framework

[MEAN](http://meanjs.org/) is the **Mongo Express Angular NodeJS** framework that Trustroots was built upon. Note that http://meanjs.org/ (inactive now) and http://mean.io/ are two separate projects. The former was a fork of mean.io in 2014: http://blog.meanjs.org/post/76726660228/forking-out-of-an-open-source-conflict

Trustroots was built on the meanjs.org version.

- [INSTALL.md](https://github.com/Trustroots/trustroots/blob/master/INSTALL.md) also contains good information about running
  and creating mock data.
